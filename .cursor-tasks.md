# Example Tasks for a "Hello, World!" Project

This file outlines a set of tasks for building a simple Next.js project. In this project, the user enters their name in a text box on the Home Page and is then greeted with "Hello, {name}" on a separate Greeting Page.

Here's an example prompt to use to generate this. Note that you'll first want to either provide a detailed set of notes / prd of exactly what to build, or have a two-step process where you have the AI create the spec, then proceed with this step:
Be sure to use an advanced thinking model with this, ideally "Deep Research" from OpenAI but o1-pro, o3-mini, flash-2-thinking, or (maybe?) DeepSeek R1 could work as well. 

``` txt
Create a very very very detailed markdown checklist of all of the stories for this project plan, with one-story-point tasks (with unchecked checkboxes) that break down each story. It is critically important that all of the details to implement this are in this list. Note that a very competent AI Coding Agent will be using this list to autonomously create this application, so be sure not to miss any details whatsoever, no matter how much time and thinking you must do to complete this very challenging but critically important task.
```

After you generate this task list, here is a prompt to use in cursor agent to kick this off (might be useful to put at the end of your cursorrules file as well?)
Probably helpful to just @include the cursor-tasks.md file as well. 
``` txt
Go through each story and task in the .cursor-tasks.md file. Find the next story to work on. Review each unfinished task, correct any issues or ask for clarifications (only if absolutely needed!). Then proceed to create or edit files to complete each task. After you complete all the tasks in the story, update the file to check off any completed tasks. Run builds and commits after each story. Run all safe commands without asking for approval. Continue with each task until you have finished the story, then stop and wait for me to review.
```

SambaScribe Project Plan - Detailed One-Story-Point Tasks
I. Core Functionality (Basic Features):

User Story 1: PDF Upload - Initial View

[x] Create a basic HTML structure for the homepage.
[x] Add a <input type="file"> element with the ID pdfUpload.
[x] Label the file input field clearly (e.g., "Upload PDF").
[x] Add basic styling to make the upload area visible and understandable.
[x] Ensure the upload area is prominent on the page.

User Story 2: PDF Upload - Successful

[x] Implement JavaScript to handle the change event on the pdfUpload input.
[x] Send the selected file to a backend endpoint (e.g., /upload).
[x] Implement a basic backend endpoint to receive the PDF file.
[x] Store the uploaded PDF file temporarily on the server.
[x] Send a success response (e.g., 200 OK) back to the frontend upon successful upload.
[x] Display a success message to the user (e.g., "PDF uploaded successfully").

User Story 3: PDF Upload - Invalid File Type

[x] In the frontend JavaScript, check the file.type property to ensure it is "application/pdf".
[x] If the file type is not PDF, display an error message to the user (e.g., "Please upload a PDF file").
[x] Ensure the backend also validates the file type.
[x] If the backend detects an invalid file type, send an appropriate error response (e.g., 400 Bad Request).
[x] Display a specific error message from the backend to the user.

User Story 4: PDF Upload - File Size Limit

[x] Define a maximum allowed file size (e.g., 10MB).
[x] In the frontend JavaScript, check the file.size property against the limit.
[x] If the file size exceeds the limit, display an error message to the user (e.g., "File size exceeds the limit").
[x] Implement a check on the backend to enforce the file size limit.
[x] If the backend detects a file exceeding the limit, send an appropriate error response.
[x] Display a specific error message from the backend to the user.

User Story 5: Notation Interpretation - Basic Success

[x] Implement a backend function to read the content of the uploaded PDF file.
[x] Research and integrate a library or method to parse Western drumming notation from the PDF content. (Critical: This requires understanding of common Samba notation conventions. The AI might need access to examples or a grammar definition.)
[x] Extract relevant musical information from the parsed notation (e.g., rhythmic patterns, note durations, accents).
[x] Store the extracted notation data in a structured format suitable for the AI model.
User Story 6: Mnemonic Generation - Trigger

[x] On the backend, after successful notation interpretation, automatically trigger the AI mnemonic generation function.
[x] Pass the structured notation data to the AI model.
[x] Handle potential errors during the AI model interaction.

User Story 7: Mnemonic Display - Initial Load

[x] Implement a backend function to receive the generated mnemonic from the AI model.
[x] Store the generated mnemonic temporarily on the server, associated with the uploaded file.
[x] Create a frontend area in the HTML to display the mnemonic (e.g., a <div id="mnemonicDisplay">).
[x] Upon successful mnemonic generation on the backend, send the mnemonic data to the frontend.
[x] Use JavaScript to dynamically populate the mnemonicDisplay div with the received mnemonic text.

User Story 8: Mnemonic Display - Clear Presentation

[x] Apply CSS styling to the mnemonicDisplay div to ensure readability.
[x] Use appropriate font size, line height, and spacing.
[x] Consider using code formatting or highlighting if the mnemonic has a specific structure.

Critical Considerations for the AI Coding Agent:

Samba Drumming Notation: The AI will need a solid understanding of Western drumming notation as applied to Samba. This includes understanding symbols for different drums, rhythms, accents, and common Samba patterns. Providing examples of Samba drumming notation in PDF format would be extremely beneficial.
AI Model Integration: The PRD mentions OpenAI Mini or Claude. The AI Agent will need to research and integrate with the chosen AI model's API. It will need to understand how to send the notation data to the model and receive the generated mnemonic.
Theme Logic: The AI needs to be able to generate different mnemonics based on the selected theme. This implies the AI model needs to be instructed on how to incorporate themes into its mnemonic generation process.
Error Handling: Robust error handling is crucial, both on the frontend and backend, to provide a good user experience.
Asynchronous Operations: Many of the operations (file upload, notation processing, AI generation) will be asynchronous. The AI Agent needs to handle these correctly using Promises or similar mechanisms.
Backend Language and Framework: The PRD doesn't specify a backend language or framework. The AI Agent will need to choose one (e.g., Python/Flask, Node.js/Express) and implement the backend logic accordingly.
Frontend Framework (Optional): While not strictly required, using a frontend framework like React or Vue.js might simplify development, especially for managing state and UI updates.
Security (Basic): While the PRD mentions no specific data privacy measures for uploaded sheets in the MVP, basic security considerations like preventing malicious file uploads should be addressed.
