## AI Analysis Results Not Displaying

**Issue Description**: 
When uploading PDF files for AI analysis, the server successfully processes the file and returns analysis data (as shown in server logs), but the results do not display in the UI.

**Current Status**:
- Backend processing works correctly (confirmed in server logs)
- API endpoint `/api/ai-process` returns data in expected format
- Data includes filename, aiSummary, and mnemonics
- UI components (AiResults, HomePage) have been updated with additional logging and error handling
- The results still fail to appear in the browser

**Technical Details**:
The server logs show successful processing and data return:
```
AI Process API received request for filename: 1743395737012-Aainjaa-Terceira.pdf
PDF file read successfully: 1743395737012-Aainjaa-Terceira.pdf, size: 173500 characters (base64)

      "Sha-ka sha-ka sha-ka cha"
    ]
  }
}

```

**Workaround**:
Currently, there is no workaround. Users should be aware that although files are being processed, results won't display in the UI.

**Next Steps for Developers**:
1. Check browser console for errors when uploading files
2. Investigate potential React state management issues in the components
3. Consider implementing a different state management solution
4. Test response format in the browser's network tab
5. Verify that the API response from client matches the expected format in the components
